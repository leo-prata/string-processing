# Data Structures Activity: String Processing

This repository contains the implementation of Part 2 of the Data Structures course project, focused on string processing. 
The project includes the implementation of pattern matching and data compression algorithms

## 1. Algorithm Implementation
At least two pattern matching algorithms, chosen from those studied in class, were implemented. If the brute-force algorithm was chosen for comparison, three routines were implemented.

## 2. Tests Performed
For each pattern matching function, the following tests were conducted:

**Test A:** Search for a name (or date) known to be at the beginning of the file.

**Test B:** Search for a name (or date) known to be at the end of the file.

**Test C:** Search for a text snippet that is not present in the file.

##  Activity - Compression

- Algorithm Implementation
  
At least two compression algorithms, preferably with distinct strategies, were implemented.

- Compression Tests
  
The dataset was compressed using each of the implemented methods, and the compression ratio was calculated for each.
